A scalable unsupervised deep learning approach extracts behavioural and demographic insights from forest elephant vocalisations

All of the analysis in this paper can be recreated by running the two notebooks saved within the main 'elephant analysis repository' folder. 

'call_types_notebook.ipynb' - performs the call-type analysis for question 1.
'rumble_subtypes_behaviour_notebook.ipynb' - performs the rumble subtype analysis (question 2) and the behavioural and demographic analysis for question 3.

The notebooks load all of the audio files stored with 'audio_dir', the annotations for these audio files stored in 'data' and the python scripts in 'elephant scripts'
